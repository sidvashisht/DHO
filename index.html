                Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common
                cold
                (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in
                cows
                and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
                Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical
                symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs
                create
                an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.

                People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported â€“ ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.

                Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

                <li>Fever or chills</li>
                <li>Cough</li>

                <p>People should NOT wear masks when exercising as masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably.
                  Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms. The important preventive measure during exercise is to maintain physical distance of at least one meter
                  from
                  others.</p>

                  The likelihood of COVID-19 being spread on shoes and infecting individuals is very low. As a precautionary measure, particularly in homes where infants and small children crawl or play on floors, consider leaving your shoes at the
                  entrance
                  of your home. This will help prevent contact with dirt or any waste that could be carried on the soles of shoes.</p>

                  There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19. If you have symptoms, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for assistance.
